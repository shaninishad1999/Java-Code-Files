// Q6. An Abundant number is a number for which the sum of its proper factors is
// greater than the number itself. Write a program to input a number and check and
// print whether it is an Abundant number or not.

// Example:
// Consider the number 12.

// Factors of 12 = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 Sum of factors = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16
